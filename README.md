# WORKSPACE-CS106-V3

Eclipse workspace used for CS106, CS165, and CS180.  It includes:
*  The **JavaCoreTemplate** (see below) project:  make a copy of this project when starting each assignment.
*  Eclipse preferences set to support easier coding in Java.


# JavaCoreTemplate

Includes:
* `Main.java`, with a `main()` that is ready to go, and has useful classes statically imported.

* Provides simple static functions that make Java a **whole lot easier to use**.  For example, to print to the screen it's just:

```java
println("Hello");
```
rather than the EVIL `System.out.println("Hello");`

Read a whole file into a String with one line of code:
```java
String quakeText = readFile("4.5_week.atom");
```
Read a file into a list of Strings:
```java
List<String> words = readFileAsLines("dict.txt");
```
Write a String to a file:
```java
writeFile("file.txt", str);
```
Write a list of strings to a file:
```java
writeFileAsLines("lines.txt", list);
```
printf w/o requiring System.out in front:
```java
printf("%d words in %s\n", words.size(), path);
print("Hello");
```
Read a line of text from the console:
```java
String s = readLine();
```
Parse ints, floats, etc w/o having to put Integer in front:
```java
parseInt/Long/Float/Double/Boolean()
```

* `commons-lang3`:  With the wonderful `StringUtils`, which has `join`, `substringsBetween`, `reverse`, etc.  For example:
```java
String[] titles = substringsBetween(quakesXml, "<title>", "</title>");
```

* [PMD](https://pmd.github.io/) support, including a tailored set of rules (`cs106.ruleset`).
